        My name is Joe Fraley. I want to share more than 15 years of experience
        teaching, performing, writing and recording music in pop, jazz, rock,
        blues, and neo soul. I spent years feeling stuck and lost with my own
        music. I wanted music to pour out of me with freedom and joy. Now Iâ€™ve
        studied proven methods that have unlocked that joy for me, and I want to
        share those methods with as many people as possible. Music and
        free-expression are a basic human right that everyone deserves to enjoy.
        That's why I always teach from a place of patience, non-judgment, and
        fun!
